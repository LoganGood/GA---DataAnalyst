    "## User Story:\n",
    "The IT department of _**Plain Corp**_ has implemented a custom-built _Computer Management Solution (CMS)_ which comes with a feature that reports information about computers in their environment such as metadata, installed programs and logins. The current problem faced by the IT team is that the reports created by CMS do not answer all the questions they have about the computers in their environment. Luckily, they figured out that the CMS stores its raw data in a SQLite (v3.45.0)  _database (DB)_ file and that they could write custom SQL queries to report the information not provided within the CMS reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal:\n",
    "Your job will be to update this Jupyter Notebook with the SQL queries needed to meet the IT team’s reporting needs. It is recommended to use a Database IDE to help with query writing and data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directions:\n",
    "Download the attached zip file which contains all the files you need to complete this assignment. Below is a description of each of the three files within the attached zip file:\n",
    "- **cms.sqlite**: The database you must query from to complete this assignment.\n",
    "- **cms_data_dictionary.txt**: A data dictionary describing the tables within this database.\n",
    "- **GA Mission - Data Analyst.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook file you must update to complete the assignment. Rules to abide by while completing this assignment are listed within this Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Expectations\n",
    "This assignment <ins>**should take you no longer than 2 hours**</ins> to complete. Make sure your outputs are visible in a web browser when uploaded to a public repository and that they are presented in a way that is understandable by someone with some technical experience but no programming experience. Extra rules to abide by are described in the included Juptyter Notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would prefer that you share the code with us by pushing it to a public repository in the hosting provider of your choosing. If you do not want to upload it to a public repository then you can zip up the repository folder on your machine and send it to us via email. If you go that route, please make sure that the .git folder is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend  that you use a Database IDE (e.g., DBeaver, Datagrip, etc.) to assist with query writing and data exploration. If you have any questions, please contact us and we will do our best to clarify anything that is unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules:\n",
    "- The code should be stored in a git repository.\n",
    "- With the exception of ***Pandas***, you can use any Python Packages you like.\n",
    "- Do not edit the data in the **cms.sqlite** DB file.\n",
    "- Your query results must be output in a _Pandas DataFrame (PD)_.\n",
    "- Questions 4 and 5 are written answer questions where no code or SQL is necessary.\n",
    "- Question 6 is a written answer question that may require code or SQL depending on your answer. This question can be thought of as a chance to share any observations you've made or perform a light EDA on the data. There are no right or wrong answers for this question."
